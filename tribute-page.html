            <li class="principal__lista--item"><p><strong class="principal__lista--destaque">1887</strong> - He founded his own Tesla Eletric Company with the help of two New York lawyers experienced in starting companies interested in his ideas and supported him financially. Developed an induction motor that operated with alternating current (AC)</p></li>
            <li class="principal__lista--item"><p><strong class="principal__lista--destaque">1888</strong> - Licensed and patented its alternating current induction motor</p></li>
            <li class="principal__lista--item"><p><strong class="principal__lista--destaque">1889</strong> - The money Tesla earned from licensing his AC patents made him independent and wealthy and gave him time and money to pursue his own interests. He traveled to the 1889 Universal Exhibition in Paris and learned about Heinrich Hertz's experiments from 1886 to 1888, which proved the existence of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves. After the exhibition, he created what turned out to be the Tesla coil.</p></li>
            <li class="principal__lista--item"><p><strong class="principal__lista--destaque">1891</strong> - At the age of 35, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.</p></li>

            <li class="principal__lista--item"><p><strong class="principal__lista--destaque">1895</strong> - Edward Dean Adams, impressed by what he saw when he visited Tesla's laboratory, agreed to help found The Nikola Tesla Company, created to finance, develop and commercialize a variety of Tesla's previous patents and inventions, in addition to the new ones.</p></li>
            <li class="principal__lista--item"><p><strong class="principal__lista--destaque">1894</strong> - Began to investigate what he called "invisible" types radiant energy after observing damaged films in his laboratory in previous experiments (later identified as "Roentgen rays" or "X-rays")</p></li>
            <li class="principal__lista--item"><p><strong class="principal__lista--destaque">1898</strong> - He introduced a boat that used a radio control based on a cohesor - which he dubbed "telautomaton" - to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden.</p></li>
            <li class="principal__lista--item"><p><strong class="principal__lista--destaque">1899</strong> - He set up a high-altitude experimental station in Colorado Springs, to further study the conductive nature of low-pressure air.</p></li>
            <li class="principal__lista--item"><p><strong class="principal__lista--destaque">1906</strong> - Due to lack of investment, his project to be able to transmit electric energy wirelessly led him to have a nervous breakdown. He had to mortgage his property to cover his debts.</p></li>

            <li class="principal__lista--item"><p><strong class="principal__lista--destaque">1943</strong> - On January 7 he died alone in room 3327 of the New Yorker Hotel.
